## About me

Since December 2024, I am a PhD student in Mathematics at the [Université de Toulouse](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr/), in collaboration with [EDF R&D](https://www.edf.fr/groupe-edf/inventer-l-avenir-de-l-energie/r-d-un-savoir-faire-mondial). I am under the supervision of [Fabrice Gamboa](https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~gamboa/) and [Jean-Michel Loubes](https://perso.math.univ-toulouse.fr/loubes/) from Université de Toulouse and [Nicolas Bousquet](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~bousquet/) and [Joseph Muré](https://josephmure.wordpress.com/) from [EDF R&D](https://www.edf.fr/groupe-edf/inventer-l-avenir-de-l-energie/r-d-un-savoir-faire-mondial).

My thesis focuses on the analysis of AI models through decomposition techniques.

Before starting my PhD, I completed a 6-month research internship at EDF R&D, where I worked on the generalization of Hoeffding Decomposition for correlated random variables.

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of statistics, probability, machine learning and linear algebra, with a particular focus on uncertainty quantification, sensitivity analysis and explainability of machine learning models.
