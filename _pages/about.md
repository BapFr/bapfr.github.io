## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Applied Mathematics at the [Université de Toulouse](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr/), in collaboration with [EDF R&D](https://www.edf.fr/groupe-edf/inventer-l-avenir-de-l-energie/r-d-un-savoir-faire-mondial), where I am working on explainability and uncertainty quantification for machine learning models in high-stakes applications.

My research is supervised by [Fabrice Gamboa](https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~gamboa/) and [Jean-Michel Loubes](https://perso.math.univ-toulouse.fr/loubes/) (Université de Toulouse), and [Nicolas Bousquet](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~bousquet/) and [Joseph Muré](https://josephmure.wordpress.com/) (EDF R&D).

Before starting my Ph.D., I completed a 6-month research internship at EDF R&D focusing on the generalization of the Hoeffding decomposition for correlated inputs, applied to uncertainty quantification.

I also hold an [M.Sc. in Statistical Learning](https://www.ip-paris.fr/education/masters/mention-mathematiques-et-applications/master-year-2-mathematics-randomness) from the Institut Polytechnique de Paris, and an engineering degree from [ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/), where I specialized in statistics, probability and machine learning.

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of applied mathematics and machine learning. I focus on:

- **Uncertainty quantification** in ML models
- **Sensitivity analysis** and **functional decompositions** (e.g. ANOVA, Hoeffding)
- **Explainability** and **interpretability** of black-box models
- **Theoretical analysis** of complex models (e.g., generalization, structure of variance)

I am particularly interested in mathematically grounded methods that improve our understanding of ML models and help build trust in AI systems.
