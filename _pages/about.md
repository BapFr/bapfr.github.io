## About me

I am a PhD candidate in Mathematics at the Université de Toulouse (EDMITT), under a CIFRE agreement funded by EDF R&D. I began my doctoral studies in December 2024. My thesis focuses on the analysis of AI models through decomposition techniques for uncertainty quantification, sensitivity analysis and explainability.

I am supervised by [Fabrice Gamboa](https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~gamboa/) and [Jean-Michel Loubes](https://perso.math.univ-toulouse.fr/loubes/), and my industrial advisors at EDF are [Nicolas Bousquet](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~bousquet/) and [Joseph Muré](https://josephmure.wordpress.com/).

Before starting my PhD, I completed a 6-month research internship at EDF R&D, where I worked on related topics in explainable AI and sensitivity analysis.

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of statistics, probability, machine learning and linear algebra, with a particular focus on:

- Hoeffding decomposition
- Uncertainty quantification
- Sensitivity analysis
- Explainable AI (XAI)

I aim to develop mathematical and algorithmic tools to better understand, interpret and control the behavior of complex AI systems, especially in the context of generative models and time series forecasting.
